# roomResponseCorrectionApp

The **roomResponseCorrectionApp** is a small application about the equalization of acoustic responses using and combining the techniques of complex smoothing and pole-fitting, aiming for both magnitude and phase correction. Even though it's name suggests only the equalization of room responses, it can be used for any acoustic impulse response.
 
This application is the result of my master's thesis. Information abou the algorithms used in this app can be found in the following links:
